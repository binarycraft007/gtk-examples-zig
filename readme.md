# gtk-examples-zig
I tried replicating the examples [here](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/getting_started.html) using zig.
I'm learning zig while I do this (and a little bit about C too I guess) so things could be improved.

My here goal is just to replicate the examples and maybe someone will find this useful.

Use this however you want.

# Run example
To run an example, simply run zig build with the example number

```
zig build example0
```

# Dependencies
  - GTK4
  - Lastest zig dev build
